<Headings.myH4>The Many Methods of The String Class</Headings.myH4>

Remember what happens when you print out the `type` of a `string`:

```python
>>> type("some string")
<class 'str'>
>>>
```

Note what is contained in those angle brackets, `<class 'str'>`.

The term, _class_, is a keyword, and it basically means that `strings` are a type of object that comes with its own functions or, more properly, _methods_.  

And, in the case of `strings` there are several [string methods in the Python library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

In fact, if you perform the following:

```python
print(dir(str))
```

you will get a print out of all the methods (and helper functions) in the `string` class:

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[0])}
  title="string methods"
  alt="Python's string methods from dir command"
/>

Some are more useful than others, and that very much depends on what you are attempting to achieve.  But a sampling here will be useful.

## str.capitalize()

From the documentation:

_Return a copy of the string with its __first__ character capitalized and the rest lowercased._

```python 
>>> "this is all lower case".capitalize()
'This is all lower case'
>>>
```

## str.center(width[, fillchar])

_Return centered in a string of length width. Padding is done using the specified fillchar ... The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to `len(s)`._

```python 


```
