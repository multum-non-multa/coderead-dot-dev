<Headings.myH4>Program Flow</Headings.myH4>

Dynamic programs must alter what they do based on the state of affairs.  If a user or a database responds one way versus another, the program --- any program worth its salt --- will respond in kind.

Take as an example a blackjack game in which the player receives two cards face up but the dealer one card down and one up.  

Assuming the player's total is less than 21, it falls to that player to decide: hit or fold.  

If he takes another card and his total is 11 or over, he takes a risk he'll go over.  If he folds, he risks falling behind the dealer.  That risk is magnified because he doesn't know the value of the dealer's second card.  

In Python the player's decision might look like this:

```python

if decision == 'hit':
    player_hand = player_hand + new_card

```

<Headings.myH4>Anatomy of an `if` Statement</Headings.myH4>

Python offers three types of conditional statements --- `if`, `elif`, and `else`.  __But__ the last two cannot be used unless and until an `if` statement starts the code.

`if` can be broken down into four parts:

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[1])}
  title="if clause"
  alt="if clause"
/>

- `if` itself

- the boolean expression

- the `:` colon marking the beginning of the block of code that follows from the statement

- the code block that runs if and only if the boolean expression is `True`.

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[2])}
  title="boolean expression"
  alt="boolean expression"
  width="100vw"
/>

The boolean expression can then be broken out into three parts:

- left value

- one of six boolean operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`,`<=` ) 

- right value

<br/>

That `if` statement cannot operate without at least those three elements.  You need at least two values to compare.  And you must decide on which boolean operator will allow the comparison to be made.  

In addition, it's important to remember that these operators return only one of two values: `True` or `False`.  

```python

>>> x = 10
>>> y = 7
>>> x != y
True
>>> x == y
False
>>> x < y
False
>>> x >= y
True
>>>
```

Regardless the choice, if the express
