Dynamic programs must alter what they do based on the state of affairs.  If a user or a database responds one way versus another, the program --- any program worth its salt --- will respond in kind.

Take as an example a blackjack game in which the player receives two cards face up but the dealer one card down and one up.  Assuming the player's total is less than 21, it falls to that player to decide: hit or fold.  If he takes another card and his total is 11 or over, he takes a risk.  The risk is magnified because he doesn't know the value of the dealer's second card.  

In __pseudo-code__ the player's decision might look like this:

```python

if decision == 'hit':
    player_hand = player_hand + new_card


```
