<Headings.myH4>Program Flow</Headings.myH4>

Dynamic programs must alter what they do based on the state of affairs. If a user or a database responds one way versus another, the program --- any program worth its salt --- will respond in kind.

Take as an example a blackjack game in which the player must decide: hit or fold.

If his current total is 11, he takes a risk that a hit will put him over. If he folds, he risks falling behind the dealer.

In Python the player's decision might look like this:

```python

if decision == 'hit':
    current_points = current_points + new_card_value

else:
  # process final score

```

In order to 'make' decisions in a program, that is, in order to alter the course of the program's operations depending on the state, one uses conditional statments, comprising keywords such as `if` and _boolean expressions_.

<Headings.myH4>Anatomy of an `if` Statement</Headings.myH4>

Python offers three types of conditional statements --- `if`, `elif`, and `else`. 

**But** the last two cannot be used unless and until an `if` statement starts the code.  Whereas, you may need nothing but an `if` statement for your purposes.  

An `if` statement can be broken down into four parts:

- the keyword `if`

- the boolean expression

- the `:` colon marking the beginning of the block of code that follows from the statement

- the code block that runs if and only if the boolean expression is `True`.

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[1])}
  title="if clause"
  alt="if clause"
/>

The boolean expression itself can then be broken out into three parts:

- left value

- one of six boolean operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`,`<=` )

- right value

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[2])}
  title="boolean expression"
  alt="boolean expression"
  width="100vw"
/>

<br />

That `if` statement cannot operate without at least those three elements. You need at least two values to compare. And you must decide on which boolean operator will allow the comparison to be made.

In addition, it's important to remember that these operators return only one of two values: `True` or `False`.

```python
# assign values
>>> x = 10
>>> y = 7
# boolean expressions
>>> x != y
True
>>> x == y
False
>>> x < y
False
>>> x >= y
True
>>>
```

Regardless the choice:

- __if the expression is true, then the code for that statement will run__. 

- __false and the program bypasses the condition entirely and moves down to the next statement__.

```python
# pseudo-code

if <expression false> :
  code_here_is_ignored

...
...
but_code_here_run


```

<Headings.myH4>The `else` Statement</Headings.myH4>

You may just want to check a single condition and then move on. But sometimes, you have two mutually exclusive alternatives. That is, if the first is true, the second is false and vice versa.

Then you express it with and `if` block followed by an `else`.  Example of control over a toggle light switch:

```python

if light_state == "on":
  # call a function that turns it off
  turn_off()

else:
  turn_on()

```

A light is either on or off. If you program controls a toggle switch, then flipping the switch one way or the other should cause the light's state to reverse. Thus, if currently on, then turn off; if off, turn on. The point:  _You have only __two__ options_.

<Blockquote display='warning'>

The <Code>else</Code> statement contains no boolean expression.  It is simply the keyword, a colon, and a code block below. It acts as a default statement.

Play around with the code below.  Tweak and run to get a feel for `if` and `else`.

<Headings.myH4>The `elif` Statement</Headings.myH4>

Often enough, you have middle ground --- a first, second, or multiple choices or possibilities you want to handle.

Then you use `elif` (sometimes more than once) and **always after** the `if` but, if you have one, the `else`.

For example, say you have scoring categories --- from 0 to 100 points gains you one level; 101 to 200 gains you another; etc.  You might code that as follows:

```python

if score <= 100:
  player = 'Proficient'

elif score <= 200:
  player = 'Highly Skilled'

elif score <= 350:
  player = 'Top Tier'

elif score > 350:
  player = 'Master'

# default - just in case
else:
  player = 'Unranked'

```

.

Far more is to come on conditionals and booleans --- nesting, logical operators, and use in loops.
