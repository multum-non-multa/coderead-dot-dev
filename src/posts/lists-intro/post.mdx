<Headings.myH4>Lists and Keeping Track of Data</Headings.myH4>

<Blockquote display="default">

<p>
  Consider a program that has to work with documents, keep track of users, log
  the IP addresses that have accessed a server, or store the names and birth
  dates of children in a school. In all of these cases, we’re storing many
  pieces of information. We’ll want to display, search through, extend, and
  modify this information.
</p>
<p>
  These are such common tasks that every programming language supports
  collections, data structures designed for handling such cases. Lists and
  tuples are [two of] Python’s built-in collections ....
</p>
<p>
  For example, a series of documents, users, or IP addresses would be best
  stored in a list—because we have many objects of the same type. A record
  containing someone’s name and birth date would be best stored in a tuple,
  because the name and birth date are of different types ....
</p>
<p>
  Because they’re mutable, lists support many more methods and operators ....
  Lists ... can be extended, contracted, and modified, as well as searched,
  sorted, and replaced.

Consider a game for which keeping track of scores is important, i.e., when you must know more than just the last value. Rather, you must know the player's history of points earned and in what order.

```python
# initialize the list with a single score of 100
scores = [100]
#
# later on add another score
scores.append(130)
# again, later on add another score
scores.append(10)

# check on all the scores
print(scores)
# prints out:
# [100, 130, 10]

```

Were it not for the `list` data structure, you might have to create a variable for every score, an impossibility when dealing with a program that is supposed run without your having to intervene or anticipate every possible score. What if you have over a hundred scores for every player? More, you may have to keep them in order.

Now, Python offers different data structures besides `lists`, but these are the most versatile and easiest to begin implementing.

<Headings.myH4>List Elements</Headings.myH4>

A `list` may contain any data type, `string`, `integer`, `float`, `booleans`, whatever object type:

```python
warner_character_023 = ["Foghorn", "rooster", 55, 2.34, True]
```

You can even store functions in the list.

This variety of data types gives the `list` even more flexibility than `arrays`, the typical default structure type in many other languages.

Of course, every advantage comes with a disadvantage, but more on that later.

<Headings.myH4>Lists Are Ordered</Headings.myH4>

Some data structures (e.g., dictionaries) may return your data in any order. However, lists maintain the data in order.

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[0])}
  title="indexed"
  alt="indexed"
/>

That means that each data element in the list has an index value, just as is the case with characters in a string. Thus, you can find and even change data elements by their index value.

<Headings.myH4>A Sampling of List Methods and Operations</Headings.myH4>

Remember some of the operations and functionality of `strings` --- retrieving by index value, slicing, concatenation. You can do all that with `lists`, and more. Because, unlike `strings`, `lists` are **mutable**.

Returning to the scoring example:

```python
>>> scores = [100, 130, 10, 43, 560, 22, 0, 0, 92]
>>> # get the last score:
>>> last_score = scores[-1]
>>> last_score
92
>>> # get the maximum
>>> max(scores)
560
>>> # get the minimum
>>> min(scores)
0
>>> # get the total
>>> sum(scores)
957
>>> first_score = scores[0]
>>> first_score
100
>>> # add another score
>>> scores.append(33)
>>> scores
[100, 130, 10, 43, 560, 22, 0, 0, 92, 33]
>>>
>>> earlier_scores = [45, 230, 21]
>>> # concatenation even
>>> scores + earlier_scores
[100, 130, 10, 43, 560, 22, 0, 0, 92, 33, 45, 230, 21]
```

<Headings.myH4>Back to Basics</Headings.myH4>

To create (or `instantiate`) a list you can simply begin with square brackets:

```python
months = []
```

with the understanding that you'll be adding to this `list` later on using, at first at least, the `append` method used above.

But you can begin with a population of items or a complete collection, e.g.:

```python
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sept', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
```

Above we've noted that, just as with `strings`, you can select by index. You can also select by range, using the same notation used for a range of characters in a `string`:

```python
>>> first_qtr = months[0:3]
>>> first_qtr
['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar']
>>>
>>> last_half = months[6:]
>>> last_half
['Jul', 'Aug', 'Sept', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
>>>
```

<Headings.myH4>Checking Membership in a List</Headings.myH4>

One keyword we've not used is `in` and its companion keyword phrase `not in`. These return a `boolean` value revealing whether an element is in or not in a `list`:

```python
>>> 25 in scores
False
>>> 'Dec' in months
True
>>> 'Dec' not in months
False
```

Like other attributes, `lists` share this functionality with `strings`:

```python
>>> "fish" in "The fish are biting"
True
>>>
```

<Headings.myH4>Mutability</Headings.myH4>

_Mutability_ has been mentioned now a number of times in various contexts.

An object is mutable if it can be changed after having been created.

If an object can be changed (like a `list` can), then it is mutable. If, to change it, you need to create a whole new version of it (think `string` as a prime example), then it is immutable.

```python
numlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numlist[0] = 'one' # change the first element, replacing it with the string 'one'
print(my_lst)
# ['one', 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

Nothing of the sort can be accomplished with `strings`.
