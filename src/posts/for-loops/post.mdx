`for` loops are designed for a known quantity, i.e., when you know you have an end to the data and need not keep track with a counter or sentinel value --- something necessary often enough in a `while` loop.

An earlier post mentioned a list of scores you might have:

```python

scores = [23, 145, 89, 9, -12]

```

But you want to go through the list and examine each score in the list. The reasons for wanting to do so are legion. You may want to multiply each score, subtract out the minimum and maximum, determine an average or standard deviation, etc. You may merely want to print them all.

<Headings.myH4>Syntax</Headings.myH4>

```python
total = 0
for score in scores:
  total += score

average = total / len(score)
```

Unlike the `while` loop:

- you do not use a boolean expression to determine whether the loop is entered

- you need not plant a sentinel value in, i.e., a counter that tells you when you've finished the loop.

<Blockquote display='info'>

You need <em>not always</em> use a counter in a `while` loop but it occurs often enough. It is the boolean expression that determines the loop's duration and that boolean expression may or may not depend on a counted value.

The `for` loop runs only until the end of the iterable, whether a `string` or `list` or whatever other `iterable` you are dealing with.

You can also merely use the loop to perform a set number of operations independent of the size or even presence of an iterable.

The `for` loop is executed throughout the length of the `iterable` and has the following syntax:  (1) the `for` keyword, (2) the element variable you choose for the loop, (3) the `in` keyword, (4) the iterable itself, and the colon `:` operator signaling the beginning of the indented code block below:

```python
main_food_groups = ["candy", "candy canes", "candy corn", "syrup"]

for group in main_food_groups:
  print(group)
```

<Headings.myH4>Example</Headings.myH4>

Whenever you create a `while` loop, you must determine what, if anything, will cause the loop to break out. No so with the `for`.

In an example under the `while` loop, we iterated through a string to determine how many vowels it contains. We can do that same a bit easier with the `for` loop:

```python
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

twelfth_night = '''
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
The quality of persons, and the time,
And, like the haggard, check at every feather
That comes before his eye. This is a practise
As full of labour as a wise man's art
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
'''

num_vowels = 0

for chr in twelfth_night:
    if chr.lower() in vowels:
        num_vowels += 1
```

The **sentinel** variable `count` was eliminated and the code was tightened up a bit.

Just as with `while` you use the keyword `break` to get out when you find what you want:

```python
for chr in twelfth_night:
    if chr == 'x':
      break
    else:
      # whatever else might be
```

<Headings.myH4>Intro to range and enumerate</Headings.myH4>

`for` loops and sequential data types are inseparable.  

You have to remember that in `strings` or `lists`, to take the most common examples of sequential types, any given element is really two values at once:  the data and the index value.  For example, in this list of state abbreviations 

```python 
states = ["AK", "AL", "AZ" ...]
```

"AK", the first element, is associated with the index value `0`, and "AL" with `1`, etc.  

And often enough you need to use that index value.  However, the problem with the `for` loop is, in its basic form, does not allow the programmer to grab that index value --- unless you want to use a clunky sentinel value you might use with `while` loops.  

Enter `range` and `enumerate`.

<Headings.myH4>Range</Headings.myH4>

<Blockquote display='default'>

Sometimes you need to loop with explicit indices (such as the positions at which values occur in a list). You can use the `range` command together with the `len` command on the list to generate a sequence of indices for use by the for loop ....

Given a number `n`, `range(n)` returns a sequence `0, 1, 2, …, n – 2, n – 1`. So passing it the length of a list (found using `len`) produces a sequence of the indices for that list’s elements. The `range` function doesn’t build a Python list of `integers`; it just appears to. Instead, it creates a `range` object that produces `integers` on demand.

```python
x = [1, 3, -7, 4, 9, -5, 4]

for i in range(len(x)):
  if x[i] < 0:
    print("Found a negative number at index ", i)

```

`range` has more than one use, e.g., wrapping it in `list()` to create a list of integer values using a single integer argument, itself not included and the start at `0`.  (cf. use with `len` above.) 

```python 
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

... or using two arguments, with the first integer argument, the start, included; the second integer argument excluded: 


```python 
>>> list(range(1, 11))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

```

With three integer arguments, the arguments represent, in order, the start, stop, and step:

```python 
>>> list(range(0, 30, 5))
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]
>>> list(range(0, -10, -1))
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
>>> list(range(0))
[]
```

<Headings.myH4>Enumerate</Headings.myH4>

The `enumerate` function improves on the `for` loop without relying on `range`.  Instead of using the latter as a counter of sorts, you can do 

```python
x = [1, 3, -7, 4, 9, -5, 4]

for i, item in enumerate(x):
  if item < 0:
    print("Found a negative number at index ", i)
```
