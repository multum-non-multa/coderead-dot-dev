`for` loops are designed for a known quantity, i.e., when you know you have an end to the data and need not keep track with a counter or sentinel value --- something necessary often enough in a `while` loop.

An earlier post mentioned a list of scores you might have:

```python

scores = [23, 145, 89, 9, -12]

```

But you want to go through the list and examine each score in the list. The reasons for wanting to do so are legion. You want to multiply each score, subtract out the minimum and maximum, determine an average or standard deviation.

You may want to merely print them all out.

<Headings.myH4>Syntax</Headings.myH4>

```python
for score in scores:
  # do something with each score
```

Unlike the `while` loop, you need not plant a sentinel value in, i.e., a counter that tells you when you've finished the loop. The `for` loop runs only until the end of the iterable, whether a `string` or `list` or whatever other `iterable` you are dealing with.

You can also merely use the loop to perform a set number of operations independent of the size or even presence of a list.

The `for` loop is executed throughout the length of the `iterable`:

```python
>>> main_food_groups = ["candy", "candy canes", "candy corn", "syrup"]
>>> for group in main_food_groups:
...     print(group)
...
candy
candy canes
candy corn
syrup
```

Whenever you create a `while` loop, you must determine what, if anything, will cause the loop to break out. No so with the `for`.

In an example under the `while` loop, we iterated through a string to determine how many vowels it contains. We can do that same a bit easier with the `for` loop:

```python
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

twelfth_night = '''
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
The quality of persons, and the time,
And, like the haggard, check at every feather
That comes before his eye. This is a practise
As full of labour as a wise man's art
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
'''

num_vowels = 0

for chr in twelfth_night:
    if chr in vowels:
        num_vowels += 1
```

The **sentinel** variable `count` was eliminated and the code was tightened up a bit.

Just as with `while` you use the keyword `break` to get out when you find what you want:

```python
for chr in twelfth_night:
    if chr == 'x':
      break
    else:
      # whatever else might be
```

<h5>From "The Quick Python Book"</h5>

Sometimes, you need to loop with explicit indices (such as the positions at which values occur in a list). You can use the <Code>range</Code> command together with the <Code>len</Code> command on the list to generate a sequence of indices for use by the for loop. This code prints out all the positions in a list where it finds negative numbers:

```python
x = [1, 3, -7, 4, 9, -5, 4]

for i in range(len(x)):
  if x[i] < 0:
    print("Found a negative number at index ", i)

```
