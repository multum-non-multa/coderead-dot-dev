Don’t repeat yourself. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

</Blockquote>

It may be unhelpful when you are first introduced to functions, but it will dawn on you soon enough:  functions allow you to repeat _operations_ without repeating the _code_ that implements them.  

Thus, functions are fundamental to the programming acronym _D.R.Y._, representing the enjoinder "__Don't Repeat Yourself__."

As mentioned in a prior post (see here: [Alfred's earlier post on functions](https://multum-non-multa.github.io/code/2021/09/06/conversion-math-module-etc.html)), Python has over three dozen __built-in__ functions such as the may we've used (and taken for granted):

- `len()` to determine the length of a `string`

- `int()` converts a data type into an `integer`

- `str()` converts a data type into a `string`

- `print()`

- `input()`

<br/>

In addition to __built-ins__, Python (as is the case of other languages) provides modules with hundreds of additional functions you can merely import and use free of charge and as often as you like.  

To take but one example, the math module contains dozens of functions, some of which are ...

```python 
>>> import math
>>> math.fabs(-234) # returns the absolute value
234.0
>>> math.factorial(12) # returns factorial
479001600
>>> math.gcd(24,54) # finds the greatest common divisor
6
```

<br/>

In addition to these few, Python math's module provides functions for use in, among others, trigonometric, algebraic, and geometric operations.

As said in a prior post, you'll be spending a lot of time crafting your own functions.  

Below is the anatomy of a function to help you understand something of what's going on under the hood with these built-in functions and the math module.

A function is essentially a _black box_.  That means that you need not know how it operates in order to use it.  

You simply need to know two things:  

- what type of thing to put in (i.e., __parameters__ to __pass__) and 

- what type of thing it will return to you (__return value__)
