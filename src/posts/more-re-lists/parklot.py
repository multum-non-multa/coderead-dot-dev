# insert method
# inserts new list elements between
# two existing elements or at the front of the list.

# insert is used as a method of lists and takes two additional arguments.
# The first additional argument is the index position in the list
# where the new element should be inserted, and the second is the new element itself:



x4 = [1, 2, 3]
x4.insert(2, "hello")
print(x4)
[1, 2, 'hello', 3]
x4.insert(0, "start")
print(x4)
['start', 1, 2, 'hello', 3]

# remove method
# ----------------------------------------
# remove looks for the first instance of a given value in
# list and removes that value from the list:
x5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5]
print(x5)
x5.remove(3)
print(x5)






# check whether 'in' a list
# If remove canâ€™t find anything to remove, it raises an error.
# You can catch this error by using the exception-handling abilities of Python, or you can avoid the problem by using  in to check for the presence of something in a list before attempting to remove it.
if 5 in x5:
    x5.remove(5)

# The reverse method is a more specialized list modification method.
