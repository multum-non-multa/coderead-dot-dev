<Headings.myH4>Types Sometimes Have to Change</Headings.myH4>

Assume these are values coming from a user input or from a data base and they appear thus:

```python

"312"
"3459012"

```

Question: Are these `integers` or `strings`?

Well, they certainly contain numbers, but the give away is that they are contained within quotation `" "` marks. That tells you they are `strings` --- even though they are `strings` containing, within them, digit characters.

Thus, given the specifications of some program, you may have to store them in variables. It turns out one is `area_code` and the other `phone_number`.

Looked at this way, you understand better what they mean. But, at this point, they are still within a `string`.

```python

area_code = "312"
phone_number = "3459012"

```

Let's say you have other `strings` containing digits and a decimal. In this case they represent the initial upward velocity and the projectile angle of an airplane, and the program is to take in this information and calculate flight duration:

```python
init_upward_vel = "4.5"
proj_angle = "43.234"

```

You need not worry about solving that problem here. Your concern is what you do with this data.

Remember: you have no choice as to how the data comes in. You can't say, "Well, just give me floating point values and integers. Then I can do math on those."

Data often comes in as `string` values. That's that.

So what to do?

<Headings.myH4>Conversion of Data Types</Headings.myH4>

Python provides an easy way to change from `string` to `number` types.

To convert a `string` to an `integer`, just use the built-in function `int()`:

```python
# convert from string to integer
>>> age = int("92")
>>> age
92
# and to check the types
>>> type(age)
<class 'int'>
```

Whereas to convert a `string` to an `float`, just use the built-in function `float()`:

```python
# convert a string to a float
>>> init_upward_vel = float("4.5")
>>> proj_angle = float("43.234")
# to check the types
>>> type(init_upward_vel)
<class 'float'>

```

<Blockquote display="info">

Note the use of <Code>type()</Code> function to check the type of the variable.

You do not have to do that, but sometimes it comes in handy.

Now, how would you take one value from a `string` of digits to use in arithmetic operations?
