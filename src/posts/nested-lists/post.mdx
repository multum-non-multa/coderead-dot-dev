A list can contain any data type, including lists themselves.

That is, instead of a list of strings (`['dog', 'horse', ...]`) or integers (`[45, 23, 12, 33, ...]`), a list may itself contain lists. As we'll see, that is quite useful.

By way of example, a list of sites and their owners and revenues might appear as:

```python

sites = [
  ['domain', 'email', 'revenues'],
  ['antonbreladoes', 'roger@wilsonrw.ze', 96141],
  ['sullivanrobertsjones', 'veron@vbz.au', 88646],
  ['walterzicons', 'sean@lowez.io', 40641],
  ['finleysteele', 'sara@bellwell.io', 48566]
]

```

_Note that that larger (or outside list) contains within it five lists, each with three items._

<Headings.myH4>Modelling Two-Dimensional Objects</Headings.myH4>

This two-dimensional list can be quite useful for modeling any number of objects. One relevant example is modelling a game board, for example tic-tac-toe:

```python

tic_tac_toe_board = [
  ['X', 'O', 'X'],
  ['O', 'X', 'X'],
  ['O', 'O', 'X'],
]

```

With these _nested_ lists, you can use loops (sometimes nested, somtimes not) to determine the data they contain:

```python

for horizontal_squares in tic_tac_toe_board:
  if horizontal_squares == ['X', 'X', 'X']:
    # note that X wins
```

(1) How would you check the vertical squares?

(2) How about the diagonal? Upper left to lower right or Lower left to upper right?

Beyond games, a list of lists is a means for modelling matrices, each row representing a vector of data.

A common equation involves transposing a matrix, i.e., 'flipping' it by 90 degrees.

Using enumeration and a nested loop, you can accomplish that. Note the creation of the `nums_transposed` list. When appending to the temporary list, `vertical`, you invert the index values --- the row's number becames the column's and vice versa:

```python
nums = [
    [2,5,6],
    [7,8,1],
    [4,9,3]
]

nums_transposed = []
for i, row in enumerate(nums):
    vertical = []
    for j, col in enumerate(row):
        vertical.append(nums[j][i])
    nums_transposed.append(vertical)

for num in nums:
    print(num)

for num in nums_transposed:
    print(num)

```

will print out:

```bash
# first matrix
[2, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 1]
[4, 9, 3]

# transposed
[2, 7, 4]
[5, 8, 9]
[6, 1, 3]

```

How might <b>this</b> be used in tic-tac-toe?
