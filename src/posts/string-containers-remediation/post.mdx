<Headings.myH4>Start with a string</Headings.myH4>

```python
"cat"
```

But a `string` is merely a **_container_**.

It **contains** characters. Here `c` and `a` and `t`.

But it might as well contain a whole book: `In the beginning, God created ...`

What do we mean by _container_?

Envision something like this:

`[ [c] [a] [t] ]`

... but defined and known by the syntax `"cat"`.

In fact, the `""` quotations marks act as a sort of wall that tell Python:

- Treat these characters as the contents of a string container.

<Headings.myH4>Data Containers</Headings.myH4>

Python has lots of container types. Right now we are focusing on `strings`. But it has `lists`, `dictionaries`, `sets`, `tuples`, and on and on. Each has advantages and each has peculiar features.

In any given container type you look for basic things it can do.

Some give you the ability to perform all four basic operations on data:

<div style={{marginBottom: '2rem'}}>

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>C</span>
  reate data

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>R</span>ead
  date

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>U</span>
  pdate data

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>D</span>
  elete data

</div>

These are, as the acronym suggests, known as 'CRUD' operations.

Not all container types provide all four features. Nonetheless they **_all_** have the ability to **_create_** and **_read_** the data stored.

Including `strings`.

<Blockquote display="info">

What sense does it make to store data but not, at the very least, be able to
retrieve and read it?

</Blockquote>

<Headings.myH4>Reading from a String</Headings.myH4>

So how do you 'read' from a `string`? That is, it's one thing to get the whole `string`, but many times you want a particular character or range of characters, not the whole thing.

**You need a window into the container**

What does a window look like?

**Well not . . .**

```python
# No!
"cat"( )
```

**Nor this . . .**

```python
# No!
"cat"{ }
```

**But this**

```python

"cat"[ ]
# where the 'window' square brackets contain an integer

```

Within that window you put an `integer` -- the index of the character's location.

For now, just think of getting one character at a time. Because the container's index values begin with `0`, in the Python `shell` you might have:

```python
>>> "cat"[0]
c
>>> "cat"[1]
a
>>> "cat"[2]
t
>>>

```

That is, if you only want a single character, just use a single integer value. **Only when you want more than a single character do you use the `[start:end]` notation with the `:` colon inserted.**

More on `strings` later; this is all you need know now.
