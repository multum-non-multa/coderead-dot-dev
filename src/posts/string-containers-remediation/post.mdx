<Headings.myH4>Start with a string</Headings.myH4>

```python
"cat"
```

But a `string` is merely a **_container_**.

It **contains** characters. Here `c` and `a` and `t`.

But it might as well contain a whole book: `In the beginning, God created ...`

What do we mean by _container_?

Envision something like this:

`[ [c] [a] [t] ]`

... but defined and known by the syntax `"cat"`.

In fact, the `""` quotations marks act as a sort of wall that tell Python:

- Treat these characters as the contents of a string container.

<Headings.myH4>Data Containers</Headings.myH4>

Python has lots of container types. Right now we are focusing on `strings`. But it has `lists`, `dictionaries`, `sets`, `tuples`, and on and on. Each has advantages and each has peculiar features.

In any given container type you look for basic things it can do.

Some give you the ability to perform all four basic operations on data:

<div style={{marginBottom: '2rem'}}>

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>C</span>
  reate data

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>R</span>ead
  date

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>U</span>
  pdate data

- <span style={{ textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>D</span>
  elete data

</div>

These are, as the acronym suggests, known as 'CRUD' operations.

Not all container types provide all four features. Nonetheless they **_all_** have the ability to **_create_** and **_read_** the data stored.

Including `strings`.

<Blockquote display="info">
  What sense does it make to store data but not, at the very least, be able to
  retrieve and read it?
</Blockquote>

<Headings.myH4>Reading from a String</Headings.myH4>

So how do you 'read' from a `string`? That is, it's one thing to get the whole `string`, but many times you want a particular character or range of characters, not the whole thing.

**You need a window into the container**

What does a window look like?

Not:

```python
# this won't work
"cat"()

# nor will this
"cat"{}
```

But this:

```python
# think box or square [ ]
"cat"[]
```
